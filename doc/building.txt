Make sure you have CMake

Go into build, and do "CMake ..". You can set the build type
if you want to build with a compiler other than the default
(e.g. -G "MinGW Makefiles"). 

CMake will try and find the needed libraries. If it can't find
them, it will build OpenGrain without them (where possible). 
You can manually set the paths to the libraries in the 
CMakeLists.txt file in the root directory.

Then just run make to build it.

If you do "cmake -DOPENGRAIN_OPTIMIZED=1" it will build a version
using the optimized source files.

If you do "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" it will debug version.
If you do "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" it will release version.
Debug and release versions are independent of the OPTIMIZED flag.
