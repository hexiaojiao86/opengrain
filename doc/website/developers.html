If you're developing for OpenGrain, this document contains some guidance as to the coding style and structure of the codebase.

<h2> How OpenGrain works </h2>

<center><img src="internals.png"></center><br>
Grains are arranged in <b>GrainStream</b>s. Each <b>GrainStream</b> has a specification for generating grains (amplitude, rate, duration envelope), which is stored in a <b>GrainModel</b> and
a source distribution which selects one from a number of <b>GrainSource</b>s. Each <b>GrainStream</b> has one or more <b>GrainSource</b> objects, which describe how to fill the specific parameters
of a <b>Grain</b> for a particular grain type (e.g. the frequency and modulation index for an FM grain). When a grain is generated, its general parameters are sampled from the <b>GrainModel</b>, and its synthesis-mode-specific values are sampled using the <b>GrainSource</b>.
This <b>Grain</b> object is then added to the <b>GrainStream</b>'s active list.
<br><br>
Each active <b>Grain</b> is synthesized and results in a mono audio stream. This stream is fed to the <b>Spatializer</b>, which spatializes each grain onto a number of output channels. The spatialization can either be per-grain or per-stream. The spatialized output is fed to a bank of per-stream effects (including resonators, virtual analog filters, FIR convolution, delays and choruses). The output of this sequence is one stream of grains.
<br><br>
Any number of these streams are then mixed by a <b>GrainMixer</b>, which subsequently applies global master effects (compression, EQ, stereo widening, and global reverb). This is then mixed into the final output buffer.
<br><br>
Every grain type has two structures: a parameter set, which contains the distributions for samping grains, and an active structure,
which contains one instance sampled from that set. For example, <b>SineGrainParameters</b> has a <b>Distribution</b> over frequencies and each <b>SineGrain</b> has a specific frequency. Each <b> Grain </b> has a set of general values that apply to all grains, and a specifics
pointer which points to the structure holding the parameters for this specific type of grain.

<h2>Coding style</h2>
<div class = "indent">
    Identifiers should not be abbreviated, and should be clear, even if that
    results in long identifiers! Functions
    are usually of the form some_action_object_type (lower case, underscore,
    with the last part giving the type the function operates on). Data
    structures are of the form ObjectType (capitalized initial letters).
    Variables should be descriptive, except for index variables like i or j. <br><br>

    Modules should be as short and simple as possible. <br><br>

    Objects should be allocated dynamically, and as little allocation as possible
    should happen during synthesis.  <br><br>
    
    Objects should usually have a create_xxx() and destroy_xxx() function 
    which take _no other arguments_ and simply allocate and possibly set 
    defaults. Configuration of the object should be done separately from 
    allocation. <br><br>
            
    Avoid hard-coded limits -- use dynamically sizable containers. <br><br>
    
    No C99 extensions (except C++ style // comments). Sadly Microsoft aren't
    likely to support C99 anytime soon. <br><br>
    
    If a parameter could be usefully used stochastically/in a time-varying way,
    use a Distribution to specify it. <br><br>
    
    Use sensible units wherever possible. Times should be seconds, 
    frequencies in Hz, and gain levels in decibels.  <br><br>

<h2> Optimization </h2>    
If you want to optimize some of the code:
<br><br>
<div class="indent">
    If the optimization doens't make the code less clear/simple, just fix it
    in the reference module file.<br><br>
    
    If the optimization is complex or messy (#ifdefs, unrolled loops etc.),
    or if it uses any platform specific code at all (ASM, relying on byte
    orders, GCC extensions) it should go in a xxx_opt.c/.h file and CMake 
    will choose that version if an optimized build is made.
